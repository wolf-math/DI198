//  this exercise, you will create your first API using Node.js and Express. This exercise will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of setting up an Express application and defining routes for different HTTP methods.

// 1. Open a text editor and create a file named app.js.

// 2. In the app.js file, require the express module and create an Express app.

const express = require('express');

// 3. Set up the app to listen on port 3000 using the app.listen() method. Print a message in the console to indicate that the server is running.

const app = express();

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('App listening on port 3000');
});

// 4. Define a GET route at /api/greetings. In the route handler, send a JSON response with a simple greeting message.

app.get('/api/greetings', (req, res) => {
  res.send({ greeting: 'ahoy!' });
});

// 5. Run the app using Node.js and test the route by opening a web browser or using a tool like curl to make a GET request to http://localhost:3000/api/greetings.

// 6. Run your app.js file using Node.js: node app.js.

// 7. Open your web browser or use a tool like curl to make a GET request to http://localhost:3000/api/greetings. You should see the JSON response with the greeting message.

// This exercise helps you get hands-on experience with building a basic Express API, defining routes, and responding to HTTP requests. It's a great starting point for learning more about the power of Express and creating more complex APIs in the future.
